This is paragraph one—packed with em dashes—testing the flow—every few words—until it stops—
But it never really stops—because there’s another dash—right here—and here—and here again—

Paragraph two begins—still obsessed with em dashes—stringing them together—like beads—on a necklace—
Sometimes they appear twice——back to back—sometimes three times———just to stress things—

Third paragraph here—long and winding—with em dashes scattered—everywhere—like breadcrumbs—
Do they hold up—under pressure—when the file is large—when the stream is constant—only one way to know—

Paragraph four steps in—cool and collected—but still—full of dashes—like a telegraph—sending signals—
Watch it replace them all—one by one—never missing—never skipping—even when they come fast—

Finally paragraph five—our grand finale—filled with dashes—at every turn—sometimes two——sometimes three———
A perfect storm—of em dashes—to make sure—our mpreg script—can handle—everything we throw—at it—
